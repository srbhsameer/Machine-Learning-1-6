These features are then incorporated into the model. Thereby, if the training set is labeled correctly, the model should be able to learn something from these features.\n",

    "By using a lot of data overfitting can be avoided, overfitting happens relatively as we have a small dataset, and we try to learn from it. But if we have a small database and you are forced to come with a model based on that. In such situation, you can use a technique known as cross validation. In this method the dataset splits into two section, testing and training datasets, the testing dataset will only test the model while, in training dataset, the datapoints will come up with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this technique, a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training (training data set) is run and a dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested. The idea of cross validation is to define a dataset to “test” the model in the training phase.\n"
